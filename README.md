📘 Infotech Project – Responsive Website

This project was created as part of an assignment given by Infotech Company to evaluate my frontend development skills. It is a fully responsive website built using HTML5 🧱 and CSS3 🎨, focusing on clean layout, simple design, and smooth user experience.

The website adapts perfectly across all screen sizes — from desktops to mobile devices 📱 — showcasing my understanding of responsive design principles and modern web styling.

This project highlights my ability to build functional, visually appealing, and accessible web pages using only HTML and CSS, without relying on external frameworks.
